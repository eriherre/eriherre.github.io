### **Project Overview**

This section highlights the structure and evolution of the website you are currently exploring. Serving as my personal portfolio, this project showcases who I am, my experience, and a diverse selection of creative work that I've developed, both independently and in collaboration with talented individuals.

### **Project Details**

The core sections of this portfolio include:

* **Home/Index**: Features an introductory banner.
* **Projects**: Showcases a broad selection of my projects.
* **Experience**: Offers a comprehensive overview of my professional history.
* **Contact**: Displays a contact form for general enquiries.

### **Development**

This website is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask), and Jinja.

### **Team and Collaboration**

### **Challenges**

### **Deployment**

At the heart of this website lies the app.py file, which serves as its backbone. Within the **templates** directory, multiple HTML files form the core structure of the website. These templates have proven incredibly valuable in reducing coding repetition and maintaining consistency throughout the site.

All static files, including images, CSS styles, and other resources, can be found in the **static** folder. This separation allows for efficient management and easy access to these files.

The following command was executed in the console to build this static website: `python app.py build`. This command triggers the necessary processes to generate the final output, which is then stored in the **/docs** directory.

### **Outcomes**

I take pride in the continuous evolution of this portfolio and am dedicated to refining its design and content with every new addition. Though it may not have the complexity of a fully dynamic site, I see it as a living digital canvas that reflects my professional growth. Over the years, valuable feedback has shaped its development, and I remain eager to learn from others. Looking ahead, Iâ€™m committed to exploring new technologies, expanding my skill set, and ensuring this website reflects my continuous journey.
