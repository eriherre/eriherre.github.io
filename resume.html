          <h3>Introduction to Criminal Justice - Undergraduate course </h3>
          <p>The NZQA Level 5 Certificate in Criminal Justice was the first project I completed with UC Online.
            Collaborating with subject matter experts (SMEs) and the educational media team, we delivered a programme
            covering various topics and unique factors that shape the criminal justice system. In this portfolio, I will
            share my experience designing one of the four courses "Introduction to Criminal Justice.</p>

          <h3>Instructional Design Basics - Microcredential</h3>
          <p>The NZQA Level 8 micro-credential Instructional design basics was one of my first completed projects with
            UC Online. It focused on learners interested in learning fundamental instructional design frameworks and
            models. I worked with one subject matter expert and the educational media team. Communication and
            collaboration were vital during this project's design and development. </p>

          <h3>Listeria Awareness - e-learning course </h3>
          <p>This short e-learning course was part of a training programme. It focuses on the crucial topic of food
            safety. For the design and development of this project, I worked with the senior instructional designer, the
            training team leader and the Quality Assurance Manager (SME). As a small team, constant communication and
            agile collaboration were fundamental to delivering the project on time due to the business needs. </p>

          <h3>Delinker System - Training course in VR</h3>
          <p>In this Virtual Reality (VR) course project, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a learning
            experience designer to transform an e-learning module into an immersive virtual experience. This redesign
            aimed to offer a hands-on learning experience in a safe environment. Throughout the design process, I was
            able to integrate my expertise in occupational health and safety with learning design principles.</p>
