  <h1>Instructional Design Basics - Microcredential</h1>
</section>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In July 2022, the Senior Instructional Designer and I were tasked with
    developing three micro-credentials (MCs) in the Learning Design series,
    collaborating closely with three Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). To optimise
    workflow, we divided responsibilities based on each SME's expertise and
    availability. I took the lead the development of the first micro-credential
    in the series.

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        During the analysis phase, we define goals, learning outcomes, and
        assessment for each MC to ensure a clear and consistent learning
        pathway. In the learner analysis, we identified that our target audience
        included teachers looking to transition into instructional design, as
        well as learning and development professionals seeking to focus on
        course design rather than technology. With this in mind, the course's
        primary goal was to equip learners with the skills needed to design
        instructional materials by guiding them through the basics of
        instructional design.

      <h3>Design and Development</h3>
      <p>
        During the design phase, I conducted two workshops with the SME,
        focusing on aligning learning outcomes, assessments, and content. I
        designed a style guide to ensure consistency across MCs. Once identified
        the required media components (videos and animations), I created
        storyboards and scripts for the Educational Media Production (EMP) team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used Rise360 to develop the course content and Storyline360 and Adobe
        Illustrator to create images and interactive graphics. The Learning
        Management System (LMS) used was Totara (Moodle version 3.5).

      <h3>Course Features and Highlights</h3>
      <p>
        The course included interactive animations, videos, and graphics, all
        designed with a consistent style guide to ensure a cohesive experience.
        A Flipgrid board was introduced to encourage interaction and foster a
        sense of community by allowing learners to record introductory videos.
        This was particularly valuable during two peer review workshops, where
        participants shared their instructional strategies and prototypes with
        peers to receive feedback. Knowing who would review their work made
        learners feel more comfortable and confident in sharing their ideas.

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        One of the main challenges was the tight 16-week deadline for developing
        the three micro-credentials. Coordinating the team’s efforts and
        aligning with the SMEs’ availability required strategic planning and
        effective time management. Additionally, maintaining consistency across
        the three MCs involved close collaboration and adherence to the style
        guide created.

        alt="The Wire Ipsum quote generator website"
      />
      <h3>Feedback and Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        The evaluation process included reviews by SMEs and a small-group
        evaluation with beta testers, using a comprehensive checklist to assess
        the course's effectiveness. Since the course was successfully launched
        in October 2022, the feedback has been positive, with learners
        expressing satisfaction that is reflected in a Net Promoter Score (NPS)
        of 8.06 out of 10.
