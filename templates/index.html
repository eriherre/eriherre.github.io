  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I'm Erika, a dedicated Learning Designer committed to creating transformative, practical learning experiences that empower learners and support organisational growth. I specialise in designing learning solutions that are relevant, accessible, and inclusive, ensuring each one meets the unique needs of individuals and organisations.
  </p>

  <p>
    With expertise in instructional design models, project and change management, and technology integration, I am proficient in tools such as Articulate 360, Adobe Creative Cloud, and LMS platforms. My strong foundation in occupational health and safety shapes my approach, enabling me to design learner-centred courses with a focus on real-world relevance. Collaboration is integral to my process; I value diverse perspectives to create engaging, high-quality learning resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout my career, I have led impactful projects across academia and industry. One notable achievement is the development of an Undergraduate Certificate in Criminal Justice for a leading university, where I transformed a face-to-face course into an engaging online program using story-based learning, which received outstanding feedback. Another success is a Food Safety Training for an industry partner, where I used the Action Mapping model to design a performance-focused module using real-world scenarios. This course significantly reduced contamination incidents, earning positive feedback from production supervisors. These projects showcase my commitment to creating results-driven learning experiences that support organisational goals and enhance learner engagement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy dancing, experimenting with new culinary creations, and immersing myself in natureâ€™s breathtaking landscapes. I also dedicate time to reading about emerging trends in education and technology, further fueling my passion for lifelong learning and innovation.
