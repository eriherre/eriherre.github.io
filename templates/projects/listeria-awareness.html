  <h1>Listeria Awareness - e-learning course</h1>
</section>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    As the busy Christmas season approaches, the company experiences a
    significant increase in new hires, making it impractical to provide
    traditional, in-person training sessions to all new employees on time. This
    type of training (Listeria awareness) is essential due to the high risk of
    cross-contamination in the production department. Without proper training,
    new staff may accidentally contribute to food safety hazards, causing severe
    health risks to consumers and damaging the company's reputation. To ensure
    that all new employees receive this crucial training efficiently, the
    learning and development team proposed an e-learning module on listeria
    awareness focussed on performance, not information, that can be accessed via
    mobile devices and completed by new hires before their first day of work.
    Integrating the training module into the online onboarding process ensures
    compliance and readiness from day one.

  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    For this course, we implemented a well-known design approach, "Action
    Mapping." So we had a few sessions with the project team (SMEs, some
    on-the-job trainers, and me) where we identified "what learners need to do"
    instead of "what they need to know".
  </p>
</section>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Design and Development</h2>
  <p>
    During this process, we brainstormed some practice activities that included
    some common mistakes new (and old) staff made in the past Christmas seasons
    and also some less common but still dangerous for customers. The core
    sections of the module include handling contaminated items and cleaning
    equipment. Once we had all these examples, I used PowerPoint (PPT) to
    develop a prototype to show the design to the SMEs. Then I used Storyline to
    create the course, we tested it with some current staff members who gave us
    feedback and also suggested other examples that challenged them in their
    daily tasks.
  </p>

  <h2>Course Features and Highlights</h2>
  <p>
    Scenario-Based Learning: The real-world scenarios included helped new staff
    understand the implications of their actions and make better decisions in
    the workplace. Also, the interactive Practice Activities engaged learners
    and allowed them to practice. This hands-on approach reinforced their
    critical behaviour.

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    One of the key challenges was effectively communicating complex procedures
    in a clear and engaging manner, while also maintaining learner interest. To
    address this, we incorporated some information in the feedback message and a
    button to access more information if they needed help.

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Feedback and Outcomes</h2>
  <p>
    The e-learning module significantly improved food safety practices within
    the company and received positive feedback from both SMEs and learners.
    Production supervisors have observed a noticeable reduction in incidents
    related to handling contaminated items and responding to cross-contamination
    situations. These improvements have directly contributed to a lower risk of
    listeria contamination, demonstrating the module's effectiveness in
    achieving its intended outcomes.
