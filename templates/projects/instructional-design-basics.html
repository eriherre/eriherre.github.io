  <h1>Instructional Design Basics - Microcredential</h1>
</section>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In July 2022, the Senior Instructional Designer and I were tasked with
    developing three micro-credentials (MCs) in the Learning Design series,
    collaborating closely with three Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). To optimise
    workflow, we divided responsibilities based on each SME's expertise and
    availability. I took the lead the development of the first micro-credential
    in the series.

  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    During the analysis phase, we define goals, learning outcomes, and
    assessment for each MC to ensure a clear and consistent learning pathway. In
    the learner analysis, we identified that our target audience included
    teachers looking to transition into instructional design, as well as
    learning and development professionals seeking to focus on course design
    rather than technology. With this in mind, the course's primary goal was to
    equip learners with the skills needed to design instructional materials by
    guiding them through the basics of instructional design.
  </p>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Design and Development</h2>
  <p>
    During the design phase, I conducted two workshops with the SME, focusing on
    aligning learning outcomes, assessments, and content. I designed a style
    guide to ensure consistency across MCs. Once identified the required media
    components (videos and animations), I created storyboards and scripts for
    the Educational Media Production (EMP) team. I used Rise360 to develop the
    course content and Storyline360 and Adobe Illustrator to create images and
    interactive graphics. The Learning Management System (LMS) used was Totara
    (Moodle version 3.5).
  </p>

  <h2>Course Features and Highlights</h2>
  <p>
    The course included interactive animations, videos, and graphics, all
    designed with a consistent style guide to ensure a cohesive experience. A
    Flipgrid board was introduced to encourage interaction and foster a sense of
    community by allowing learners to record introductory videos. This was
    particularly valuable during two peer review workshops, where participants
    shared their instructional strategies and prototypes with peers to receive
    feedback. Knowing who would review their work made learners feel more
    comfortable and confident in sharing their ideas.

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    One of the main challenges was the tight 16-week deadline for developing the
    three micro-credentials. Coordinating the team’s efforts and aligning with
    the SMEs’ availability required strategic planning and effective time
    management. Additionally, maintaining consistency across the three MCs
    involved close collaboration and adherence to the style guide created.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Feedback and Outcomes</h2>
  <p>
    The evaluation process included reviews by SMEs and a small-group evaluation
    with beta testers, using a comprehensive checklist to assess the course's
    effectiveness. Since the course was successfully launched in October 2022,
    the feedback has been positive, with learners expressing satisfaction that
    is reflected in a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 8.06 out of 10.
