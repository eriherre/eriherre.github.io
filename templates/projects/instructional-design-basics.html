  <h1>Instructional Design Basics - Microcredential</h1>
</section>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The development of one of the three micro-credentials (MCs) in the Learning Design series was a collaborative effort focused on creating clear, consistent, and engaging learning pathways. Targeted at teachers transitioning into instructional design and learning professionals aiming to focus on the foundations of instructional design, the primary goal was to equip learners with basics instructional design skills.</p>
<P>Through strategic workshops with the Subject Matter Expert (SME), we aligned learning outcomes, assessments, and content. I ensure consistency across the courses with the creation of a visual style guide. Using tools like Rise360, Storyline360, and Adobe Illustrator, I developed course materials, hosted on the Totara LMS. Features such as interactive animations, videos, and a Flipgrid board fostered learner interaction and peer collaboration. Despite a tight deadline, the project was delivered on time, achieving a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 8.06 out of 10, and earning positive feedback for its innovative and engaging approach to professional development.

  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    During the analysis phase, we defined goals, learning outcomes, and
    assessment for each MC to ensure a clear and consistent learning pathway. In
    the learner analysis, we identified that our target audience included
    teachers looking to transition into instructional design, as well as
    learning and development professionals seeking to focus on course design fundamentals
    rather than technology. With this in mind, the course's primary goal was to
    equip learners with the skills needed to design instructional materials by
    guiding them through the basics of instructional design.
  </p>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Design and Development</h2>
  <p>
    During the design phase, I conducted two workshops with the SME, applying the Dick and Carey model to systematically align instructional strategies with learning objectives and content. This approach ensured a cohesive and effective learning design approach. To maintain consistency across the course, I developed a comprehensive style guide, which was also used for the development of the other micro-credentials. After identifying the required media components, such as videos and animations, I created detailed storyboards and scripts for the Educational Media Production (EMP) team, ensuring that all multimedia elements supported the instructional goals. Using tools such as Rise360, Storyline360, and Adobe Illustrator, I designed engaging course content with interactive graphics. The courses were hosted on the Totara LMS.

  <h2>Course Features and Highlights</h2>
  <p>
    The course included interactive animations, videos, and graphics, all
    designed with a consistent style guide to ensure a cohesive experience. A
    Flipgrid board was introduced to encourage interaction and foster a sense of
    community by allowing learners to record introductory videos. This was
    particularly valuable during two peer review workshops, where participants
    shared their instructional strategies and prototypes with peers to receive
    feedback. Knowing who would review their work made learners feel more
    comfortable and confident in sharing their ideas.

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>

    One of the key challenges was meeting a tight 16-week deadline to develop three micro-credentials. 
    Successfully coordinating the team’s efforts and aligning with SMEs’ availability demanded strategic
    planning and efficient time management. Ensuring consistency across all three MCs required close 
    collaboration and attention to detail. This approach was essential to maintaining a cohesive and high-quality learning experience across the series.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="portfolio-section">
  <h2>Feedback and Outcomes</h2>
  <p>
    The evaluation process involved detailed reviews by SMEs and a small-group evaluation with beta testers, 
    utilising a detailed checklist to assess the course's effectiveness. The course received overwhelmingly positive feedback, achieving a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 8.06 out of 10. Learners highlighted the clarity and presentation of the content, emphasising its 
    practical relevance to their roles, which significantly enhanced their learning experience.
